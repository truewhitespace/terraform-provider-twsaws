# twsaws_rotating_keys (Resource)

Manages a user's AWS access keys, attempting to gracefully rotate out aged keys while keeping an active key.  A kay may
be in one of three states:
* Active - An active key should be the use in use.  Agents should gravitate towards utilizing this key as quickly as
possible.
* Grace - The key is scheduled for deletion at a later time and should be considered expired for all agents.  A key in
a grace period is intended to allow for seamless rotation of credentials. 
* Expired - The key should no longer be used.  A resource with expired keys will delete them.

If the resource queries AWS with two or more keys in a grace period then one will be chosen at random to be destroyed.

Grace and expiration times are determined by the provider.
